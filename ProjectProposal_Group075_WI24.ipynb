    "- Specifically, how do earnings differ between individuals with differing major types, how does the choice of major influence these earnings disparities, and assess the applicability of their education to their career path?

    "The relationship between major types, wages, and the applicability of that major degree has been an interesting subject of inquiry within the field of labor economics. This research question delves into pivotal sources that shed light on the economic and professional implications of major selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \"Education Pays, 2021\" report provides a foundational perspective on the broader economic value of educational attainment, revealing how different levels of education correlate with varying median weekly earnings and unemployment rates. The report underscores the premise that higher educational levels typically afford higher earnings and lower unemployment risks. This backdrop is crucial for our analysis, setting the stage to dive deeper into how specific major choices within these educational levels further influence early career outcomes. Although the BLS data is expansive across educational levels, it highlights the importance of further investigation into the nuances of major selection, pointing towards the need for more detailed, major-specific analyses [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the Pew Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trend Project report, \"The Economic Value of College Majors: The Rising Cost of Not Going to College,\" states an in-depth examination of wages associated with 137 college majors. It distinctly illustrates the lifetime earnings gap between the highest and lowest-paying majors and identifies STEM, health, and business majors as among the highest-paying. This analysis is particularly relevant to our research question as it directly relates major selection to financial outcomes and, by extension, to the perceived applicability and usefulness of education in one's career path. The report's findings on major-specific earnings, coupled with its insights into the popularity and economic benefits of earning an advanced degree by undergraduate major, provide a comprehensive understanding of the tangible and intangible impacts of major selection on post-graduate success [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these sources equip us with a robust framework to explore how different academic majors impact early career wages and the subjective evaluation of major relevance in professional settings. By analyzing both the broad economic trends highlighted, we aim to uncover nuanced insights into the implications of major choice on early career trajectories and the alignment of educational backgrounds with career aspirations.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that, on average, individuals who have more science-oriented major graduates will be significantly more likely to work at a job that uses their major and make significantly more money than humanities or art-related majors. We recognize that the relationship between job opportunities and wages varies across different majors, influenced by the demand for specific skills, the marketability of those skills, and the dynamic nature of job markets. To account for these variations, our analysis will segment data by field of study and account for factors such as the sample size surveyed for each major and the possible range of errors within the data set. We will also be pulling from a database with over 1 million total individual points of data taken by the US census, so it will be an accurate and correct representation of the relations that exist. This methodology aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how the major is used in post-graduate jobs and how that influences the amount of money those individuals make."

    "information on academic majors, early career wages, employment sectors, and other relevant metrics such as job satisfaction, major-specific employment rates, type of degree, annual earnings, and relevance of job to the major. Additionally, demographic info such as gender, ethnicity, and age groups could provide necessary information into the disparities. Our analysis will leverage publicly available datasets that provide comprehensive insights into the relationship between academic majors and career outcomes in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we use below is particularly suited for this analysis as it contains detailed info on 173 different college majors and 5,709,666 observations, making it well within the typical expectation for a comprehensive analysis which often revolves around datasets with about 1000 observations or more. In this case, each major serves as an observation, with the dataset providing a rich array of features for each such as rank (rank by median earning), major, major_category, total (number of people w/ a major), men, women, share women (proportion of female graduates), median, full_time, and part_time. Its coverage of majors and associated economic outcomes makes it a key resource to understand the economic value of college majors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the richness of our dataset, we can explore various angles, like the gender distribution within majors, the relationship between the share of women in a major and the median wages, and the distribution of college vs. non-college jobs across different fields of study. In addition, this dataset focuses on recent datasets and provides insight into how different fields of study correlate with economic success in the labor market. Overall, its structured format allows for efficient data processing, enabling an examination of the relationship between academic disciplines and employment outcomes. \n"
