    "The relationship between major types, wages, and the applicability of that major degree has been an interesting subject of inquiry within the field of labor economics. This research question delves into pivotal sources that shed light on the economic and professional implications of major selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \"Education Pays, 2021\" report provides a foundational perspective on the broader economic value of educational attainment, revealing how different levels of education correlate with varying median weekly earnings and unemployment rates. The report underscores the premise that higher educational levels typically afford higher earnings and lower unemployment risks. This backdrop is crucial for our analysis, setting the stage to dive deeper into how specific major choices within these educational levels further influence early career outcomes. Although the BLS data is expansive across educational levels, it highlights the importance of further investigation into the nuances of major selection, pointing towards the need for more detailed, major-specific analyses [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the Pew Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trend Project report, \"The Economic Value of College Majors: The Rising Cost of Not Going to College,\" states an in-depth examination of wages associated with 137 college majors. It distinctly illustrates the lifetime earnings gap between the highest and lowest-paying majors and identifies STEM, health, and business majors as among the highest-paying. This analysis is particularly relevant to our research question as it directly relates major selection to financial outcomes and, by extension, to the perceived applicability and usefulness of education in one's career path. The report's findings on major-specific earnings, coupled with its insights into the popularity and economic benefits of earning an advanced degree by undergraduate major, provide a comprehensive understanding of the tangible and intangible impacts of major selection on post-graduate success [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these sources equip us with a robust framework to explore how different academic majors impact early career wages and the subjective evaluation of major relevance in professional settings. By analyzing both the broad economic trends highlighted, we aim to uncover nuanced insights into the implications of major choice on early career trajectories and the alignment of educational backgrounds with career aspirations.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that, on average, individuals who have more science-oriented major graduates will be significantly more likely to work at a job that uses their major and make significantly more money than humanities or art-related majors. We recognize that the relationship between job opportunities and wages varies across different majors, influenced by the demand for specific skills, the marketability of those skills, and the dynamic nature of job markets. To account for these variations, our analysis will segment data by field of study and account for factors such as the sample size surveyed for each major and the possible range of errors within the data set. We will also be pulling from a database with over 1 million total individual points of data taken by the US census, so it will be an accurate and correct representation of the relations that exist. This methodology aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how the major is used in post-graduate jobs and how that influences the amount of money those individuals make.\n"

    "information on academic majors, early career wages, employment sectors, and other relevant metrics such as job satisfaction, major-specific employment rates, type of degree, annual earnings, and relevance of job to the major. Additionally, demographic info such as gender, ethnicity, and age groups could provide necessary information into the disparities. Our analysis will leverage publicly available datasets that provide comprehensive insights into the relationship between academic majors and career outcomes in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we use below is particularly suited for this analysis as it contains detailed info on 173 different college majors and 5,709,666 observations, making it well within the typical expectation for a comprehensive analysis which often revolves around datasets with about 1000 observations or more. In this case, each major serves as an observation, with the dataset providing a rich array of features for each such as rank (rank by median earning), major, major_category, total (number of people w/ a major), men, women, share women (proportion of female graduates), median, full_time, and part_time. Its coverage of majors and associated economic outcomes makes it a key resource to understand the economic value of college majors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the richness of our dataset, we can explore various angles, like the gender distribution within majors, the relationship between the share of women in a major and the median wages, and the distribution of college vs. non-college jobs across different fields of study. In addition, this dataset focuses on recent datasets and provides insight into how different fields of study correlate with economic success in the labor market. Overall, its structured format allows for efficient data processing, enabling an examination of the relationship between academic disciplines and employment outcomes. \n",

    "This indicates that there are 6 majors with median salaries significantly higher or lower than the majority, qualifying them as outliers based on the statistical analysis using the Interquartile Range method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the outliers in the `Median` salary analysis is essential because they represent specialized fields with high earning potential, accurately reflecting real-world salary variations. These outliers provide crucial insights for prospective students making career decisions and ensure a comprehensive analysis of the job market for recent graduates. By including these data points, the analysis maintains its integrity, offering a nuanced understanding of employment outcomes across various majors and highlighting the exceptional earning opportunities in certain fields. Removing these outliers would not only skew the dataset towards lower-earning majors but also omit critical information necessary for informed decision-making and policy formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Variable renaming and encoding:*** We ensured that variable names were clear and concise. For categorical variables. We determined no need to rename variables or for encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Removing irrelevant columns:*** We did not identify irrelevant columns, therefore we did not remove any column as we determined each provided meaningful information to our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Standardization and normalization:*** Standardization or normalization is not necessarily required for straightforward comparisons or exploratory analysis. The salary variables, such as `Median`, `P25th`, and `P75th`, are inherently designed for direct comparison across different academic disciplines. The decision to keep outliers, due to their relevance in illustrating the potential for high earnings in certain specialized fields, suggests a cautious approach to any transformation that might obscure these valuable insights. Standardization, typically beneficial for aligning data points across a common scale, is less critical here as the primary focus is on understanding and visualizing salary distributions rather than preparing the data for computational models where uniformity in scale is crucial!\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is clean and ready for analysis. It has been thoroughly checked for missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and irrelevant columns. All variables are appropriately formatted, and the data follows the principles of tidy data. No further preprocessing steps are necessary to use the dataset for analysis.\n"

    "    - For our analysis, we specifically used a dataset regarding graduates' employment outcomes, which was sourced from publicly accessible repositories on GitHub and Data. These platforms host datasets under conditions that permit academic and research use, provided the data is publicly listed. Our dataset's public availability on GitHub signifies the repository owner's consent for its use, aligning with GitHub's policy that distinguishes between private and public repositories. Data similarly hosts datasets with explicit licensing, clarifying permissible uses. By selecting a dataset from a public GitHub repository and Data. We ensured our project adhered to open data principles and respected the intentions of the data contributors. \n",

    "    - While our dataset is derived from reputable sources and reflects information from the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB), we acknowledge the inherent potential for biases and discrepancies. These could stem from the survey design, data collection methods, or the representation within the dataset. Recognizing these limitations, we have undertaken our analysis with a commitment to minimizing these biases, ensuring our interpretations and conclusions are as accurate and unbiased as possible. The original data collection by the USCB is guided by stringent protocols to ensure accuracy and reliability, and our analysis seeks to extend these principles by critically evaluating the data and its implications.\n",

    "3. ***Data Privacy:***\n",
    "    - Our dataset focuses on the relationship between educational attainment, major choice, and wages, without including personally identifiable information. This approach aligns with the data privacy policies of both the USCB and GitHub, ensuring the anonymity of individuals represented in the dataset. The USCB's privacy policy is rigorous, protecting survey participants' information, and by using a dataset based on their data, we inherit these privacy protections. GitHub's policy on datasets prohibits the sharing of personal information like addresses or phone numbers, and our adherence to using an anonymized dataset ensures we respect individual privacy while facilitating our analysis. This careful consideration of privacy concerns underscores our commitment to ethical research practices, allowing us to explore important educational and economic questions responsibly."
